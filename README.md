## Tech Stack
- Frontend-
  >React with JSX: For building a dynamic, component
   based UI that supports real-time 3D rendering and
   responsive design.
  >Three.js (WebGL): For rendering high-fidelity 3D
   anatomical models with smooth interactions (zoom,
   rotate, dissect). 
  >Tailwind CSS: For rapid, customizable styling that
   ensures a consistent, accessible UI across devices.
- Backend-
  >Node.js with Express: For creating a scalable REST
   API to handle report uploads, user authentication,
   and 3D model metadata. 
  >TensorFlow.js: For client-side AI to detect user
   preferences (e.g., learning style) and parse medical
   reports using NLP.
- Database-
  >MongoDB: For storing user profiles, model
   metadata, and learning progress.
   MongoDBâ€™s flexibility with unstructured
   data suits the varied needs of patient
   reports and student activities.
  >Cloudinary / Firebase Storage: For hosting
   large 3D model files or scanned medical
   reports.
